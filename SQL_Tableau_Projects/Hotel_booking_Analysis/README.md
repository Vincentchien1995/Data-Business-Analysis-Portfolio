## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Top vs Bottom Hotel Performance** → High-performing hotels serve as benchmarks, while low-performing ones may require improvement in overall guest satisfaction.  
- **Rated Dimensions** → Guests place greater value on experience-driven factors (comfort, facilities, staff engagement) over cost or location convenience.  
- **Visitor Demographics** → The majority of guests are from the US and UK, with the 25–34 age group forming the dominant segment, followed by 35–44.  
- **Traveler Type Preferences** → Solo travelers prioritize staff interaction; couples value comfort; family and business travelers focus on facilities.  
- **Expectation vs Reality** → Underperforming hotels compared to baseline expectations indicate refinement opportunities, while outperformers can be used as reference models.
