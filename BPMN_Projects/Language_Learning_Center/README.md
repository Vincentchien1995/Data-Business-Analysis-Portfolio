# Language Learning Center – Business Process Modeling

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end workflow design** for a Language Learning Center, bridging:  
- Business analysis → process mapping  
- Process modeling → database structure design  
- Communication flows → system integration  

It showcases my ability to connect **business logic** with **data architecture** through **BPMN 2.0** and **ERD modeling**.

## 🧩 Overview
The system was designed to automate and streamline three core operations:
1. **Class Booking** – managing proposals, scheduling, and tuition payments  
2. **Student Registration** – handling new student applications and account creation  
3. **Tutor Application** – managing tutor recruitment, eligibility review, and scheduling setup  

Together, these workflows form a complete educational management process.
