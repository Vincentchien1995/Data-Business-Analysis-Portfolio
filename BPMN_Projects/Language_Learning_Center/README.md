# Language Learning Center – Business Process Modeling

This project presents a **Business Process Modeling and Database Design** for a Language Learning Center.  
It models the interactions between students, tutors, and departments using **BPMN 2.0** and **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**.

---

## 🧩 Overview
The system was designed to automate and streamline three major operations:
1. **Class Booking** – managing class proposals, scheduling, and tuition payments.  
2. **Student Registration** – handling new student applications and account creation.  
3. **Tutor Application** – managing tutor recruitment, eligibility review, and schedule setup.

These workflows together form the backbone of a fully functional educational management system.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Integrated class booking and payment confirmation reduced manual coordination between departments.  
- Tutor scheduling and appointment linking were standardized via one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.  
- The design enhances communication between HR, Finance, and Customer Service departments.

## 🧾 Project Summary
This project demonstrates the **end-to-end workflow design** for a Language Learning Center, bridging:
- Business analysis → process mapping  
- Process modeling → database structure design  
- Communication flows → system integration  

It forms part of my **Data & Business Analysis Portfolio**, showcasing my ability to connect business logic with data architecture.
